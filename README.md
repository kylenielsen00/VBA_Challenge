# VBA_Challenge

                                                              Stock Analysis
                                                              
              The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect stock information from the years 2017, 2018 to determine which options of stocks were best for investing in.  Included are 2 charts with information on 12 different stocks to retrieve the ticker, total daily volume, and return for each stock.  By refactoring the code I was able to decrease the total run time of the code significantly.
